# About the game

Blast Runner is a fast-paced endless runner game where players navigate a character through an endless series of obstacles. The primary goal is to jump over obstacles and collect points using an innovative directional jump mechanic.

Gameplay Mechanics:
- The character runs automatically, continuously moving forward through the level.
- Players tap and drag on the screen to control the jump direction. The character jumps in the direction indicated by the touch, allowing precise control over movement.
- Various obstacles appear on the path. Players must use the directional jump mechanic to avoid these obstacles.
- Points are collected by picking up embers throughout the level. The objective is to collect as many points as possible.

Prepare for endless excitement and test your reflexes in Blast Runner, where every jump counts and every ember fuels your high-score chase!
